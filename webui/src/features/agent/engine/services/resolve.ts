/**
 * Pure service resolution (G1): decide per kind whether to use the user's key
 * (byok), our metered proxy (managed), or nothing (off).
 *
 * Precedence:
 *   1. preferManaged + managed available → managed (opt-in metering),
 *   2. a usable BYOK key present         → byok (BYOK wins by default; a
 *      configured key is never silently metered),
 *   3. managed available                 → managed,
 *   4. otherwise                         → off.
 *
 * "managed available" = signed in AND `managedAllowed(kind)` (default true). No
 * network, no React — one deterministic function so the whole matrix is tested.
